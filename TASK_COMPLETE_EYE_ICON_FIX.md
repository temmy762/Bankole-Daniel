# 🎯 TASK COMPLETED: Eye Icon Fix

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED
**Issue**: The "view more" eye icon in portfolio listings was non-functional when clicked.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript initialization timing issue where `portfolioManager` was assigned to global scope before being initialized.

**Solution**: Fixed the initialization order in `js/portfolio.js` to ensure proper global access.

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIX APPLIED

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
let portfolioManager;

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    portfolioManager = new PortfolioManager();
});

// ❌ This assigned 'undefined' to window.portfolioManager
window.portfolioManager = portfolioManager;
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
let portfolioManager;

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    portfolioManager = new PortfolioManager();
    // ✅ Export for global access after initialization
    window.portfolioManager = portfolioManager;
});
```
